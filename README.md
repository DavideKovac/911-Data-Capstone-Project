There are many possible outcome that can be obtained from this graph. For example realising where, when and what are the main emergency in determinated zone of the county, that can lead on a better deploy of force , change of particular procedure in sepcific area. We can also identify which day , hour and month are the one that cause more incident. Obviously this data are little data set on a more complex scheme, but they can lead to some good idaea to improve the local service
